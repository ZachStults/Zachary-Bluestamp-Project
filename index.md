# Sun Following Solar Panel Phone Charger
My goal is to make a solar panel capable of charging my phone. In order to maximize the output of the panel, it will be able to follow the sun as it moves throughout the sky.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is having my project be fully operational, with the panel being able to charge my phone as well as follow the sun. It was a challenge to get everything working because my USB connectors were faulty, and it only worked once a new one was ordered. After getting everything soldered and glued, my panel, sensors, motor and phone charger are all working according to plan.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was creating the stand for my panel, as well as getting my photoresistor to read. Building the stand came with some frustration, as I realized that after I had already built it, my design was flawed and I had to rework it. After completing this I was able to hook up my photoresistor to my Arduino and run some code for it to output some data. The photoresistor worked great, giving low values in low light and high values in high light.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was proving that my solar panel worked, as well as running the sweep command on my servo! Both of these things were essential for my project, because the servo and panel are two very important parts of my project. To prove the panel worked, I bought a cheap flashlight and took out the LED. I then hooked it up to the solar panel's jumper cables, and was able to make it shine brightly!
